Amazon QuickSight helps us to analyse data and create visualisations easily. Today we're going to analyse a huge dataset of Netflix shows and movies to create a dashboard that extracts all the juicy insights.

Here's the game plan that i will followup to dashboard complete! In this project, we will:

🪣 Upload a dataset into an S3 bucket.
    
🆕 Create an account on Amazon QuickSight.
    
🔗 Connect our dataset (in the S3 bucket) to Amazon QuickSight.
    
📊 Create a variety graphs, charts and analysis using QuickSight.

        1. Visualise a catalogue of TV/movies by release year, list category and added date.
    
        2. Experiment with different visualisation styles - for example, donut, table or bar graphs.
    
🏆 Publish a dashboard full of insights into our dataset!
