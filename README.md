Welcome to the AWS-Project1 repository! This project demonstrates how to use Amazon QuickSight to analyze and visualize data effectively. We'll be working with a substantial dataset of Netflix shows and movies to build a dashboard that uncovers valuable insights.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Analyze a huge dataset of Netflix shows and movies.
- **Tool**: Amazon QuickSight
- **Outcome**: Create a dashboard to visualize and extract meaningful insights from the data.


## Project Plan

Here's the game plan that i will followup to dashboard complete! In this project, we will do the following :

- ü™£ **Upload** the dataset into an S3 bucket.
  
- üÜï **Create** an Amazon QuickSight account.
  
- üîó **Connect** the dataset (from the S3 bucket) to Amazon QuickSight.
  
- üìä **Visualize** the data:
  
  - Create graphs and charts to explore TV/movies by release year, category, and added date.
    
  - Experiment with various visualization styles, such as donut charts, tables, and bar graphs.
    
- üèÜ **Publish** a comprehensive dashboard with insights.

## Cleanup

To avoid unexpected charges, I have terminated all resources used in this project:

1. **Terminated** the QuickSight account.
2. **Deleted** the S3 bucket.
